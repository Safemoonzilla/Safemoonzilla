Safemoonzilla is deployed by a former safemoon mysterious member. The contract ownership is permanently relinquished. The transaction tax is 12%, which effectively reduces the whale arbitrage. The 8% dividend is safemoonzilla. It does not need you to claim it, and it will be automatically increased in your wallet in real time.
